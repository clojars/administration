name: JAR Deletion
about: Requesting deletion of a JAR
---

<!--
If you are requesting a JAR deletion, please read the following

JARs are removed from Clojars for two reasons:

* There is a security vulnerability in a published JAR, i.e. malicious code
* Private credentials or code have been published.

Otherwise JARs are not deleted, to preserve the immutable nature of the Clojars repository.

If your deletion request fits one of the two reasons, push a new version with "Delete me" in the description to prove ownership of it.

You can find more details on the deletion process [here](https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/wiki/About#how-do-i-delete-a-jar).

Thanks!

I am requesting deletion of my JAR because:

- [ ] There is a security vulnerability in a published JAR, i.e. malicious code
- [ ] Private credentials or code have been published.

If you are not requesting deletion for either of those reasons, we will not delete your artifact.
